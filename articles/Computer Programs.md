The [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/computer-program) defines a _computer program_ as "a set of **instructions** that makes a computer **do** a particular **thing**." 

The main idea of a computer program is to make **logic operations** on some kind of **data** (for example, numbers, texts, images, music, videos etc). This defines the two main categories of operations performed by a computer program:

- accessing information / storing information
- making operations on that information

For example, a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel can:

- Load or save numbers from a file on the hard-drive
- Apply operations on these numbers (additions, etc)
