# Creating Magnetic Fields

### Creating a magnetic field

Some materials called _ferromagnetic_ materials can be magnetized, using a large magnetic field to align their internal magnetic orientations. Once magnetized, these materials emit a constant magnetic field.

Yet, there is another way of creating a magnetic field. When electric charges move, they actually create themselves a magnetic field. A constant electric current in a wire will generate a constant magnetic field. The equations that rule this phenomenon are called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biot-Savart_law">Biot-Savart</a> equations. 

To make the magnetic field stronger, we usually use a coil instead of a single wire. This device is called an **electro-magnet**. You can generate a magnetic field by switching on this device (for example, connecting it to a current generator), and turn off the magnetic field by turning off the device. 

This device is actually using the reverse principle that is used for a current generator. Instead of moving a magnet inside a coil to move electrons, we move electrons to generate a magnetic field.
