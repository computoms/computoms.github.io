# Electric Force

The electric force is the force applied by a particle of charge `q` to other particles with a charge. The following formula gives the value of the electric force that a particle of charge `q_1` applies on another particle of charge `q_2` separated by distance `r`: 

`F = k q_1 * q_2 / (r * r)`

where `k` is the Coulomb's constant.

## Moving electrons, generating a current

How do we actually force electrons to move inside a metal? Using the above formula, one way to do this would be to have, at one end of a piece of metal, a large _fixed_ charge `q_1` (i.e. a battery). The other way to make them move is by using a current generator (see next posts).
