# Hard Drives

Hard drives are non-volatile data storage. This means that data remains unchanged when power is turned off. It is usually the cheapest and biggest memory in a computer, and is where you typically save your files, photos and other data you want to keep. One of the disadvantage of this type of memory is that it is usually slow (mostly due to hardware implementation).

The two main hard drive implementations are:

* Magnetic drives
* Flash drives, also called Solid State Drives
