# Electrons Spin

The **spin** of particles, an intrinsic property of sub-atomic particles such as electrons and protons/neutrons, is responsible for the magnetic orientation of atoms. The magnetic orientation is also called the _magnetic moment_. 

The spin is the property of sub-atomic elementary particles that is responsible for the magnetic force and for the properties related to magnets.
