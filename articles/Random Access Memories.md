# Random Access Memories

Random access memory (RAM) is where the non-persistent data is stored on your computer. It is a volatile data storage. When starting a program, the operating system loads the content of the program into the RAM memory and the program's data is stored within the RAM memory.

The RAM memory is relatively fast to access, but looses its data when power is turned off. It needs a certain amount of power to be refreshed and to avoid loosing its data.
