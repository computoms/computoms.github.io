# Storing Numbers

Computer memories are based on physical and electrical principles that only allow to store two states. These states are represented by convention with 0 and 1. It is called a _binary state_.

Only one numeric system allows to count with two digits: the binary system.

- We need a way to encode these numbers in order to store and retrieve the correct information. Let's say our memory is a sheet of paper containing a row of squares, with each square being able to contain a digit (from 0 to 9). If we want to store the number 17 and then the number 5, we can write the following digits into our row of squares: 1, 7, 5. But then, if someone else comes and reads this "paper memory", how does he know we stored 17 and 5, and not 175? or 1 and 75? To answer these questions, we use **Data Types**.

- How to convert any number (integer, negative integer, fractional) into a form of binary representation (using only 0s and 1s)? This is the subject of **Number Encodings**.
