# Number Encodings

## Encoding positive integral numbers

Usually, we work with the decimal base to represent numbers, with digits from 0 to 9. The number 127 thus represents: 1*(10*10) + 2*(10) + 7.

In computer memories, we only have access to two states (0 and 1) so we must convert integral numbers to binary. To "understand" a binary number, we can use the same formula but on base two: 1101 in binary represents: 1*(2*2*2) + 1*(2*2) + 0*(2) + 1.
