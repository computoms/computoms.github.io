# Computer Memories

In a computer, there are three categories of hardware components that can store data. These categories each have their own characteristics and are used for different steps of data transfer, storage and processing.

Computer memories can thus be divided into:

* **Hard drives**, storing data persistently. The data written to them are saved even in case of power outage.
* **Random-access memories**, storing data of programs running on a computer. These kind of memories are not resistant to power outages.
* **Processor cache memories**, storing transitting data to the processor.
