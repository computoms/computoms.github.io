## About CompuToms
<span id="about" />

The idea of this website is to explore computer algorithms by trying to have a complete overview of the mechanisms. From the physical principles behind them to the electronics hardware on which they can be implemented. And from the hardware to the abstract ideas they are based on. 

## The author
<span id="author" />

My name is Thomas Beck. I am a young physicit and computer scientist. I have always been intrigued and curious about how our surrounding Nature works. Curiosity is for me the driver to learn new things. Computer science is part of it and is one of the things that I discovered and learnt about out of curiosity. 

I am passionate about learning and solving problems. This led me to complete a masters' degree in Physics at the Lausanne Institute of Technology (EPFL). This gave me the technical background as well as the methodology to approach many kind of problems with rigor and analysis. 

## Hobbies
