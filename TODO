    Data storage:
        ☐ Storing variables: the stack and heap memories
        ☐ Storing "objects"
        ☐ Storing a program and its data
    Data structures:
        ☐ Arrays
        ☐ Linked lists, stacks and queues
        Remark: why are we saying that an array has O(1) lookup instead of O(k) for a linked-list => link to DRAM/SRAM structures
        ☐ Hash tables, sets, dictionaries
        ☐ Graphs and Trees
    Data processing:
        ☐ Processing numbers: arithmetics
            Speak about endianess
        ☐ Comparisons and logic operations
            Ref to electronic logic gates
        ☐ Compilation
        ☐ Program execution (startup, virtual address space)
