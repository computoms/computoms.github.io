The data storage category is a collection of articles explaining how computers are storing data. It tries to explain such storage mechanisms from the physical principles to the implementations.

It starts by listing the different [storage types]({% post_url 2019-03-31-Data-storage %}) used in a computer. Then, describes the [physical mechanisms]({% post_url 2019-04-09-data-storage-fundamental-principles %}) and [interactions]({% post_url 2019-04-16-data-storage-interacting-with-matter %}) that are used behind data storage components. The [electronic components]({% post_url 2019-04-30-data-storage-electronic-components %}) used in such storage medias are then presented. This lays the fundations to understand the two main types of computer storage: [random access memories]({% post_url 2019-07-23-data-storage-random-access-memories %}) and [persistent storage medias]({% post_url 2019-08-12-data-storage-persistent-storage %}).

The voyage continues on to how we can [store numbers]({% post_url 2020-04-27-storing-numbers %}), and [characters]({% post_url 2020-05-11-storing-characters %}).
