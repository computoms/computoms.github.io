### Current generator

A current generator is a device that converts mechanical motion into electrical current. It is based on the magnetic part of the Lorentz' force. That is, when no electric field are present in a region of space:

$$\vec{F} = q \vec{v} \times \vec{B}$$

Now let's imaging we have a fixed metal wire inside which electrons can move if they feel a force $$\vec{F}$$. If we take this wire close the a fixed permanent magnet and move it along the magnet, the electrons inside the wire will have a speed, with respect to the magnet, equal to the speed at which we are moving the wire. The resulting force of amplitude $$F = q v B$$ (if the wire is moved perpendicularly to the magnetic field $$B$$ of the magnet at speed $$v$$) will be applied on each electron of charge $$q$$. 

> Include a figure to show the principle

Now mechanically, this is not very efficient. We have to move a long wire along a fixed magnet and then collect the current on this wire. What if we bend the wire into a coil around the magnet; and make the coil rotate around the magnet. This would actually result in the same force on each electron. 

Better.

Now in the formula, $$\vec{v}$$ is actually the velocity of a charge particle with respect to a fixed magnetic field. This is equivalent to having a fixed charged particle with moving magnetic field $$\vec{B}$$ at velocity $$\vec{v}$$. In this case, we could have a fixed wire and make the magnet move along the wire. Or we could have a fixed coil around a spinning magnet. This is actually even better in terms of mechanic, because it allows to input our mechanical motion onto the spinning magnet and collect the current at the output of the coil with a fixed electrical circuit. 

> Include a figure of the current generator

This is the basic idea behind which a current generator is made. There are a lot of ways to actually construct a current generator, but they are all based on the same physical principles explained above.
