# The physical principles behind data storage

## Electromagnetism

As we know, matter is composed of molecules that are in turn composed of atoms -- electrons gravitating around a small dense nucleus of protons and neutrons. These tiny particles have different intrinsic physical properties, such as a **mass**, an **electric charge** and a **spin**. These properties are very interesting to store and process information.

---------------- Merge ----------------

### Weight & the gravitational field

Let's start by using the _mass_ property of matter to show some physical interactions, that are very similar to the ones we actually use to store data in our computers.

If you hold an apple with your hand and suddenly drop it, it will fall on the floor. This is due to it's weight. It's "weight" is actually the force applied on it by the Earth's mass. Two masses attract each other by a force that is proportional to their distance and to their masses: $$\vec{W} = G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$ (where $$\vec{W}$$ if the force between the two masses, $$G$$ is a constant, $$m_1$$ and $$m_2$$ are the masses and $$r$$ is the distance between the masses).



> Explain using the parallel between mass / gravitational field vs. electric charge / electric field. Should we use another, simpler, parallel?

### Moving electrons

Now, how do we actually force electrons to move inside a metal? To understand this, we need to understand the relationship between the electric field and the magnetic field. 


### Description of a field (not really necessary?)

But what is a _field_? Tricky question. 

> A field is a "quantity" that has a value in each point of the space. 

For example, you can define the "wind field" as being the intensity of the wind on each point of the Earth's surface. 

Fields have been invented by physicists to describe more easily the interations of matter, such as the attraction between two masses. 

In a similar manner as we defined the gravitational field, we can also define the electric field. The electric field is the value of the force that attracts a charge particle (like the electron) around another charged particle.

> Explain magnetism and magnetic fields, generated by **moving** charges

> Explain how to move electrons using a generator

## Abstractions

### Electric charge

 The electric charge of an electron is negative and measured in Coulomb (about $-1.6\cdot 10^{-19}$ C which we'll write $-e$) whereas the one of a proton is positive ($+e$) and the one of a neutron is null. Two electric charges of the same sign (for example, two electrons) repel each other while two electric charges of the opposite sign attract each other. 

 In conductive materials, such as most metals, electrons can freely move and hop from one atom to the other where there is some space available while atomic nucleus are fixed. Using the electric attraction/repulsion forces, we can force electrons to move through a conductive material. This creates a current (= moving eletric charges). We can also force them to move to a piece of metal, and then isolate this piece of metal (preventing the electrons to go out of the piece of metal). This creates a charged metal piece.

 In summary, we can do two things with the electric force:

 * Store eletric charges (add electrons to a piece of isolated metal)
 * Move electric charges (create a current) through a conductive material, by connecting two pieces of metal with different stored electric charges

 For example, we use batteries or capacitors to store electric charges. In contrast, we use light bulbs to generate light from the flow of electrons.

#### Storing charges

A capacitor is a small electronic component which is composed of two metal sheets that are separated by an isolating material. 

This component can be used to store an electric charge. Let's imagine we use lots of these components in an array with possibility to choose which one we want to connect. This allows us to charge or discharge a particular capacitor. 

#### The DRAM

### Spin & Magnetism



**Side note**

 We can think of the two following terms as follows:

> **Electicity**: using the motion of electric charges to do something (i.e. produce light, heat, mechanical motion) or move charges.

> **Electronics**: using the electric charges to process or store data.
