This article summarizes the series on data storage. Through this series of 5 articles, we saw the principles on how the data is stored in a computer from the physical point of view to the implementation. 

## Why is data storage important at all?

Data storage is a fundamental component that is linked to algorithm design. Thourgh the [Data storage]({{site.url}}/data-storage/2019/03/31/Data-storage/) article, we saw that storing data can be key to designing an algorithm. 

## Fundamental principles

Data storage is based on 3 physical quantities: the mass, the electric charge and the spin of the particles of matter that we use: electrons. The motion of these particles is govered by 4 fundamental laws of physics (the grativational force, the electro-magnetic force and the two nuclear forces) on which only one is at play when talking about data storage: the electro-magnetic force.
