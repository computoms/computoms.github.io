## Storing magnets: the hard drive

The interesting property of ferromagnetic materials, which are used to make permanent magnets, is we can actually _change_ their permant magnetic field orientation by applying a large magnetic field on them to force the orientation of the magnetic orientations inside the material. 

Let's imaging we can arrange on a line a series of ferromagnets separated by some distance. Let's align their magnetic fields in the same direction. Now, take a strong magnetic field generator, say a strong electro-magnet. If we want to encode information into our system, we can approach the electro-magnet to the ferromagnets representing positions where we want to encode bit 1 and switch it on to chage the orientation of these magnets while keeping the others to the initial orientation (representing bit 0).

This is the idea behind a magnetic hard drive.
