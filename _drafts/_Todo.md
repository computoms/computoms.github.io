## Data storage

*- Fundamental principles
*- Interacting with matter
*- Electronic components
- Memories
*  - RAM memories (DRAM, SRAM)
  - Persistent memories (Magnetic hard drives, flash, SSD)

-> Missing: how to read a magnetic field, how to read a current (in interacting with matter)
-> Make a summary of this data storage part with links to sub-articles. 
 
## Information storage 
- Storing numbers
- Storing letters
- Memory usage (stack vs. heap)

- (?) How memory is used (stack / heap)

## Data processing

- Processing data using electronic gates (ref. post on logic circuits)
- Structure of the processor
  - Caches, logic parts, layers etc.

## Data structures

- Arrays: fixed-sized, pointers, dynamic
- Lists: linked-lists etc
- Hash tables
